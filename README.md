# Simple CLI Blackjack
This is a game I made for fun and to learn python. There are some rough edges, but no major bugs (afaik!).
Pygame is required for the music, although there's no music included - yet.

---------

This game is best played with the numerical keyboard.
You can use "3" to hit, or as confirmation to double down or split hands. Think of it as "yes".
Pressing enter with no input will be treated as "no", or stand.

If you don't know how to play Blackjack or need some info, you can type "rules" at any time
to open a -not affiliated- webpage with the Blackjack rules the game uses.

The game also accepts a "names.txt" file in the same folder to use as names for the CPU players.

To add music, create a folder called "music" in the same path as the game, and add your files there.

I think that's it, enjoy! If you've any questions or feedback feel free to contact me.
